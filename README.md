üê∂üê± Dog vs Cat Image Classification
Overview
This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification system that distinguishes between images of dogs and cats. The model is trained using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Features
Classifies images as either Dog or Cat.
Trained on the Kaggle Cats and Dogs Dataset.
Built using a CNN architecture for high accuracy in image classification tasks.
Provides data augmentation techniques to improve generalization.
Visualizes model accuracy and loss with Matplotlib.
Tech Stack
Python: Core language for developing the model.
NumPy: Used for numerical computations and matrix operations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and exploration.
Matplotlib: Visualizing dataset distributions and model performance.
TensorFlow/Keras: Building and training the CNN model.
Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing is the famous Dogs vs. Cats Dataset, which consists of:

Training Data: 25,000 labeled images of cats and dogs.
Test Data: 12,500 unlabeled images for prediction.
You can download the dataset from here.
